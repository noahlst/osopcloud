# About Storage and Application Data

With Storage on Osopcloud, your Badges, Settings, and works in Osopcloud Composer persist after you close your current session. You can come back to Osopcloud tomorrow and each of these will be the same.

## Overview

Storage is stored by your web browser. If you've installed Osopcloud as an app, this is the web browser that's "hosting" the app.

Storage uses client-side web technologies. It's impossible for Osopcloud servers to see what's in Storage. More about privacy is outlined in the Osopcloud Privacy Notice.

## Offline Experience Cache

Osopcloud automatically downloads content in the background so that you can use Osopcloud without a network connection.

On compatible browsers, you can find a storage usage estimate in Application Storage Management.

There is no limit on the cache size. Moreover, the cache applies for each individual browser, so, if you use Osopcloud across many browsers, you may get into a situation where Osopcloud is storing 100s of megabytes on a single device. Use your browser settings to clear the Offline Experience Cache.

## Import or Export Storage

If you need to take your Badges, Settings, or Composer work to another browser or device, use Osopcloud's built-in Storage import and export features.

### Export Storage

1. Open Settings.
2. Select "Application Storage"
3. Then select "Export Storage Data to Clipboard"

This will copy a JSON string to your clipboard which you can paste into a file or send to another device.

### Import Storage

1. Open Settings
2. Select "Application Storage"
3. Then select "Import Storage from Clipboard"
4. If prompted with a permissions dialog, select "Allow" or "Paste"

The imported settings will overwrite your current settings.

<Note m={true}>
  When you use the Import Storage from Clipboard feature, your full clipboard is
  revealed to the application.
</Note>

<Note m={true}>It isn't possible to import settings on Mozilla Firefox.</Note>
