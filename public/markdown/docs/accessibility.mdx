## Accessibility

Making Osopcloud accessible is a big priority for our team.

We've implemented a handful of accessibility features, which are described below. We plan to implement more in the future.

---

### Font

We use a custom font. To change the application font, go to Settings and select the "Change the Application Font" option. A modal will appear and offer you these options:

- **Atkinson Hyperlegible:** A broad-based font made to put accessibility first. Developed by the Braille Institute of America and contributors.
- **System Font:** This will tell the app to use the system font. Select this option if you have a custom font applied to the entire OS.

To restore the default font, go to Settings, select "About the Osopcloud Application" and then "Reset Osopcloud".

### Motion

To reduce animations across the app, configure your operating system accessibility settings. Look for a toggle to "reduce motion" or "reduce animations" and enable it.

### Tab Button

The `tab` button on your keyboard can be used to go through buttons, links, and other input elements, starting at the navigation bar. To select that button, press `enter` or `return`.
