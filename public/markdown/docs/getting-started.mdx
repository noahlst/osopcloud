## Getting Started

### The 2 Core Pages

To get started, you need to do is go home. Across Osopcloud, you can go home by selecting the Osopcloud logo ("blasting past the clouds") in the left of the navigation bar.

There's 2 cores to Osopcloud. There's Home, and there's what we call operating system pages. OS pages are designed to give you everything you need to know about that operating system.

### Home

Home is the key to operating system pages, and therefore the key to our content base, which is powered by contributors.

Home has two components. Both help you discover OSs:

- **8-way Search:** Search for OSs by name, or by 7 additional metadata categories.
- **The Operating System List:** This is an alphabetical list showing all the operating systems that are on Osopcloud.

### Operating System Pages

Operating System Pages describe operating systems. There's be lot of information here:

- **There's a description:** A detailed breakdown of the strengths and features of the OS.
- **There's our metadata:** Our metadata gives you short and sharp insights across different aspects of the OS. Something special here is that lots of metadata is searchable with 8-way search.
- **There's links:** Taking you to the project website and repository.
- **There's donation options:** You can use donation options to easily donate to the project through a selection of external services.
