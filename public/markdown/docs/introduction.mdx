## Introduction

Welcome to Osopcloud!

It's a big and varied scene out there; with Linux, BSD, and more on the scene, each with their own strengths and features. So, we wanted to build a place where they can come together and discovering them is easy and modern.

We want to have a set of tools here which both familiar and new users can use to culture build this community.

Thanks team.
