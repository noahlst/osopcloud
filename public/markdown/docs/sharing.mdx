## Share Points

Across Osopcloud, you see buttons with a "Share" label.

These are called Share Points.

When you select a Share Point, the native share sheet appears. This allows you to share Osopcloud pages and content with the other apps on your system, or with your friends.

Share Points is one of the many subtle culture building tools. By sharing open-source operating system culture with your apps and friends, you can help develop this community further.

> **Note:** Share Points are hidden on browsers that don't support them, including Mozilla Firefox.
