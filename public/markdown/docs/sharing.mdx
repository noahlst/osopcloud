## Share Points

Across Osopcloud, you see buttons with the share icon or the "Share" label.

These are called Share Points.

When you select a Share Point, the native share sheet appears. This allows you to share Osopcloud pages and content with the other apps on your system, or with your friends.

Share Points are one of the many subtle culture building tools. By sharing open-source operating system culture with your apps and friends, you can help develop this community further.
